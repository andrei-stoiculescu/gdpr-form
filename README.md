# gdpr-form

A simple web app I developed using dompdf and signature_pad in order to make GDPR form signing easy. It can be of course used for other documents signing purposes.

It's very simple to use - you have to fill in the form and sign it at the bottom of the page using the mouse or your finger, after which a pdf file is generated. 

The signed form can be automatically sent to a designated email address (for this you have to edit the pdf.php file).

All the forms are saved inside the assets/ folder.
